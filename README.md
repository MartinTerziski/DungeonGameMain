This is an individual project of plain Java, called DungeonGame. It is based on a textual turn-based game, where you choose your class with roleplay elements and fight through an abandoned village.

You can choose between 3 classes with different powers and history (Juggernaut, Spell Invoker and Marksman). The character must fight through the challenges in the village, for it to be cleansed by a savior's hand. The main commands are Basic Attack, Use of a Spell (depending on the Mana bar) and Using a potion. The character can also level up and increase his stats by your choosing.

The main purpose of this project is to be considered as a portolio, in which the usage of Java OOP Concepts(Inheritance, Polymorphism...) and types of Design Patterns is present.
